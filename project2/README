The main code for this project is written in python, since the socket implementation in python is easy to use.

We started out by following the implementation outline on the project page,
initially focusing on the spanning tree algorithm and making sure our debugging was working properly.
By having detailed logs, it made following packets through the system much easier
and we were able to work from there. There were almost no problems with the forwarding tables,
however our spanning tree algorithm was constantly a problem due to a number of complex edge cases.
For testing, we simply used the various test scripts available to us. They were very helpful in
determining which packets were problematic, drawing a diagram, and determining the edge case that was missing.
We were then able to fine tune for the remaining handful of missing packets by doing things like clearing
the forwarding table more intelligently.
